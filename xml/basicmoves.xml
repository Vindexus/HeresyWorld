<h1>Basic Moves</h1>
<Story><h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Hack and Slash</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">When you <strong>attack an enemy in melee</strong>, roll+STR. On a 10+ you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack. On a 7–9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.</p>
<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Aim and Fire</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndentPreList">When you <strong>aim and fire your ranged weapon</strong>, roll+DEX and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add +1d4 damage. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:</p>
<ul aid:pstyle="OptionsList"><li>You take what you can get, deal -1d6 damage</li>
<li>You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon</li>
<li aid:pstyle="LastListItem">You have to place yourself or a teammate in danger, the GM will tell you how</li></ul>
<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Suppressing Fire</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">When you <strong>fire a weapon at one or more targets to suppress them</strong>, roll+DEX and expend 1 use of your weapon. On a hit the target's morale is tested: they might dive for cover, falter, or attempt to flee. Your allies gain +1 forward against them. On a 10+ you also deal your damage.</p>
<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Reload</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">When you <strong>take a moment to reload your weapon</strong> reset your weapon's uses and expend 1 ammo.</p>
<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Throw Grenade</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndentPreList">When you <strong>prime and throw a grenade</strong>, roll+DEX. On a 10+, the grenade lands where you aimed. On a 7-9 choose one:</p>
<ul aid:pstyle="OptionsList"><li>The grenade lands where you aimed but you have to move to make the throw placing you or someone else in danger as described by the GM</li>
<li aid:pstyle="LastListItem">The grenade only lands near where you aimed, for a reduced or unexpected effect as described by the GM</li></ul>
<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Defy Danger</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndentPreList">When you <strong>act despite an imminent threat</strong> or <strong>suffer a calamity</strong>, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it…</p>
<ul aid:pstyle="OptionsList"><li>…by powering through, +STR</li>
<li>…by getting out of the way or acting fast, +DEX</li>
<li>…by enduring, +CON</li>
<li>…with quick thinking, +INT</li>
<li>…through mental fortitude, +WIS</li>
<li aid:pstyle="LastListItem">…using charm and social grace, +CHA</li></ul>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear. On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.</p>
<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Defend</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">When you <strong>stand in defense of a person, item, or location</strong> under attack, roll+CON. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. So long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:</p>
<ul aid:pstyle="OptionsList"><li>Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself</li>
<li>Halve the attack’s effect or damage</li>
<li>Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker</li>

<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Spout Lore</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">When you <strong>consult your accumulated knowledge about something</strong>, roll+INT. On a 10+ the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. On a 7–9 the GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the truth, now.</p>
<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Discern Realities</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">When you <strong>closely study a situation or person</strong>, roll+WIS. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9 hold 1. As the situation unfolds or as you interact with the person, spend hold to ask the GM questions from the list below.</p>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndentPreList">Either way, take +1 forward when acting on the answers.</p>
<ul aid:pstyle="OptionsList"><li>What happened here recently?</li>
<li>What should I be on the lookout for?</li>
<li>What here is useful or valuable to me?</li>
<li aid:pstyle="LastListItem">What nearly escaped my notice?</li></ul>
<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Parley</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">When you <strong>have leverage on a GM character and manipulate them</strong>, roll+CHA. Leverage is something they need or want.

<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Tech-Use</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndentPreList">When you <strong>attempt to use or fix a complicated piece of technology</strong> roll+INT. On a 10+ you do what you set out to do and choose two. On a 7-9 the same, but choose one:</p>

<li aid:pstyle="LastListItem">You get a lesser result than you intended, the GM will tell you what</li>
<li aid:pstyle="LastListItem">The grenade only lands near where you aimed, for a reduced or unexpected effect as described by the GM</li></ul>
<h2 aid:pstyle="MoveName">Aid or Interfere</h2>
<p aid:pstyle="NoIndent">When you <strong>help or hinder someone you have a bond with</strong>, roll+Bond with them. On a 10+ they take +1 or -2, your choice. On a 7–9 you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.</p></Story></Root>
