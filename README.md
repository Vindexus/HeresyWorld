# Heresy World
Heresy World is an unofficial hack of Dungeon World that ports it over to the Warhammer 40k universe with the intention of having players play a game similar to Dark Heresy. That is, players play Acolytes of an Inquisitor who must root out heresy in the Imperium of man.

## License
Heresy World's main mechanics are based on [Dungeon World](http://dungeon-world.com) with other mechanics and great deal of the fluff being taken from the Dark Heresy 1st and 2nd editions by Fantasy Flight Games.
