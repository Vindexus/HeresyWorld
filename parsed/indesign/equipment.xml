<Root><h1>Equipment</h1>
<p>The weapons, armor, and tools your characters bring on their mission can have a huge impact on how successful you are: a more robust piece of armor could turn a blade that would mean 
death; a silencer attached to a laspistol might mean you aren't discovered, and pair of magnocs could help you witness a key event in your investigation.</p>
