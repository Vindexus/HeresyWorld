# Basic Moves

>## Aim and Fire
>When you **aim and fire your ranged weapon**, roll+DEX and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add +1d4 damage. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:
>
>  - You take what you can get, deal -1d6 damage
>  - You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon
>  - You have to place yourself or a teammate in danger, the GM will tell you how

Aim and Fire is your go to move when a character is shooting to kill. It covers drawing, cocking, aiming, and shooting your weapon. Firing your weapon doesn't mean squeezing off a single shot, it means shooting for a few seconds. That can mean a single shot, or a whole flurry of them. Either way, it's a single use of the weapon. Leave the exact number of shots to the fiction and let the uses dictate when they run low.

If you're using a weapon that doesn't have enough uses you can't take the bonus damage on the 10+ or the "expend another use" option on a 7-9.

>## Suppressing Fire
>When you **fire a weapon at one or more targets to suppress them**, roll+DEX and expend 1 use of your weapon. On a hit the target's morale is tested: they might dive for cover, falter, or attempt to flee. Your allies gain +1 forward against them. On a 10+ you also deal your damage.

If you're shooting at the enemy for almost any effect other than to deal damage, you're likely using suppressing fire. You might still land a few shots, but what you're trying to keep heads down so your allies can take advantage.

>## Reload
>When you **take a moment to reload your weapon** reset your weapon's uses and expend 1 ammo.

Once a character has expended all the uses of their weapon they need to reload. This isn't assumed, the players have to explicitly say they take a moment to reload. How long it takes is up to the GM, and reloading certainly counts as a prime opportunity for a GM move.

>## Throw Grenade
>When you **prime and throw a grenade**, roll+DEX. On a 10+, the grenade lands where you aimed. On a 7-9 choose one:
>
>  - The grenade lands where you aimed but you have to move to make the throw placing you or someone else in danger as described by the GM
>  - The grenade only lands near where you aimed, for a reduced or unexpected effect as described by the GM

Pulling out a grenade and chucking it can all be done in one motion, but only if you have a grenade on hand. As a GM, the 7-9 results give you a lot of opportunity for interesting hard moves, don't be afraid to use them. A wily cultist might see an Acolyte fumbling for a grenade as a perfect opportunity to charge them. A grenade might fall short and deal half damage, or it might catch an ally in its blast. Explosives can also change the landscape of the battlefield by creating firewalls, caving in walls, making craters, or destroying cover.

>## Tech-Use
>When you **attempt to use or fix a complicated piece of technology** roll+INT. On a 10+ you do what you set out to do and choose two. On a 7-9 the same, but choose one:
>
>  - It takes longer than you'd planned
>  - You have to cannibalize some equipment on hand, the GM will tell you what
>  - You get a lesser result than you intended, the GM will tell you what

What requires a Tech-Use roll depends a lot on what tech is being used, the character who's trying to use it, and what they're attempting to do. A player from a Forge World with an Adeptus Mechanicus Background probably won't need to roll for Tech-Use when attempting to search a cogitator unit for a specific file, but someone from a Feral World with no experience with advanced tech might. Something more complicated, such as hacking a security system or overriding a sentry gun, might require a roll from the Forge World character and simply not be possible at all for the Feral World character. Keep the fiction in mind, and only roll when necessary.

>## Discern Realities
>When you **closely study a situation or person**, roll+WIS. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9 hold 1. As the situation unfolds or as you interact with the person, spend hold to ask the GM questions from the list below.
>
>Either way, take +1 forward when acting on the answers.
>
>  - What happened here recently?
>  - What should I be on the lookout for?
>  - What here is useful or valuable to me?
>  - What nearly escaped my notice?

Discern Realities has changed a bit from Dungeon World. The list of questions has been changed and limited, and it now uses a hold mechanic. This means that you can save your questions until an opportunity presents itself, which allows the game to continue if you can't think of any on the spot. Remember that you may only spend hold to ask questions of the situation or person you examined. You can't spend hold you gained scouting out the enemy ambush to ask questions about the cultist priest who shows up later on in the battle.
