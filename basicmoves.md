# Basic Moves

## Aim and Fire
When you **aim and fire your ranged weapon**, roll+DEX and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add +1d4 damage. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:

  - You take what you can get, deal -1d6 damage
  - You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon
  - You have to place yourself in danger, the GM will tell you how

 
### Suppressing Fire
When you **fire a weapon at one or more targets to suppress them**, roll+DEX and expend 2 uses of your weapon. On a hit the target's morale is tested: they might dive for cover, falter, or attempt to flee. Your allies gain +1 forward against them. On a 10+ you also deal your damage to one of your targets.

## Reload
When you **take a moment to reload your weapon** reset your weapon's uses and expend 1 ammo.

## Throw Grenade
When you **prime and throw a grenade**, roll+Dex. On a 10+, the grenade lands where you aimed. On a 7-9 choose one:

  - The grenade lands where you aimed but you have to move to make the throw placing you in danger as described by the GM
  - The grenade only lands near where you aimed, for a reduced or dangerous effect as described by the GM
