# Basic Moves

## Aim and Fire
When you **aim and fire your ranged weapon**, roll+DEX and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add +1d4 damage. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:

  - You take what you can get, deal -1d6 damage
  - You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon
  - You have to place yourself in danger, the GM will tell you how

 
## Suppressing Fire
When you **fire a weapon at one or more targets to suppress them**, roll+DEX and expend 1 use of your weapon. On a hit the target's morale is tested: they might dive for cover, falter, or attempt to flee. Your allies gain +1 forward against them. On a 10+ you also deal your damage.

## Reload
When you **take a moment to reload your weapon** reset your weapon's uses and expend 1 ammo.

## Throw Grenade
When you **prime and throw a grenade**, roll+DEX. On a 10+, the grenade lands where you aimed. On a 7-9 choose one:

  - The grenade lands where you aimed but you have to move to make the throw placing you in danger as described by the GM
  - The grenade only lands near where you aimed, for a reduced or dangerous effect as described by the GM


## Tech-Use
When you **attempt to use or fix a complicated piece of technology** roll+INT. On a 10+ you do what you set out to do. On a 7-9 the same, but choose one:

  - It takes longer than you'd planned
  - You have to cannibalize some equipment on hand, the GM will tell you what
  - You get a lesser result than you intended, the GM will tell you what

## Fight Your Fear
When you **witness a terrible sight**, roll+WIS. On a 10+ you steel yourself against the horrors you see, take +1 forward.  On a 7-9 you maintain your resolve, but your mind is shaken - you take -1 forward. On a 6- you gain 1 insanity.

## Insanity
Whenever you **gain a point of insanity** roll+insanity. On a 10+ choose an affliction from the list below and reset your insanity to 0. Describe how it affects your character. 

  - Your dreams are forever troubled
  - You become paranoid
  - You are sometimes plagued by visions
  - You develop a nervous tick

On a 6- do not mark xp.
