# Basic Moves

>## Aim and Fire
>When you **aim and fire your ranged weapon**, roll+DEX and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add +1d4 damage. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:
>
>  - You take what you can get, deal -1d6 damage
>  - You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon
>  - You have to place yourself or a teammate in danger, the GM will tell you how

Aim and Fire is your go to move when a character is shooting to kill. It covers drawing, cocking, aiming, and shooting your weapon. Firing your weapon doesn't mean squeezing off a single shot, it means shooting for a few seconds. That can mean a single shot, or a whole flurry of them. Either way, it's a single use of the weapon. Leave the exact number of shots to the fiction and let the uses dictate when they run low.

If you're using a weapon that doesn't have enough uses you can't take the bonus damage on the 10+ or the "expend another use" option on a 7-9.

>## Suppressing Fire
>When you **fire a weapon at one or more targets to suppress them**, roll+DEX and expend 1 use of your weapon. On a hit the target's morale is tested: they might dive for cover, falter, or attempt to flee. Your allies gain +1 forward against them. On a 10+ you also deal your damage.

>## Reload
>When you **take a moment to reload your weapon** reset your weapon's uses and expend 1 ammo.

---

>## Throw Grenade
>When you **prime and throw a grenade**, roll+DEX. On a 10+, the grenade lands where you aimed. On a 7-9 choose one:
>
>  - The grenade lands where you aimed but you have to move to make the throw placing you in danger as described by the GM
>  - The grenade only lands near where you aimed, for a reduced or dangerous effect as described by the GM

---

>## Tech-Use
>When you **attempt to use or fix a complicated piece of technology** roll+INT. On a 10+ you do what you set out to do. On a 7-9 the same, but choose one:
>
>  - It takes longer than you'd planned
>  - You have to cannibalize some equipment on hand, the GM will tell you what
>  - You get a lesser result than you intended, the GM will tell you what

---

>## Discern Realities
>When you **closely study a situation or person**, roll+WIS. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9 hold 1. As the situation unfolds or as you interact with the person, spend hold to ask the GM questions from the list below.
>
>Either way, take +1 forward when acting on the answers.
>
>  - What happened here recently?
>  - What should I be on the lookout for?
>  - What here is useful or valuable to me?
>  - What nearly escaped my notice?
