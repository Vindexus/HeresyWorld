# Character Creation

## Choose a Class
Look at the list of classes and choose one that interests you. Your Inquisitor's retinue doesn't need two of the same type of class, so if two people want the same class talk it over like adults and compromise.

## Choose a Background
Your background describes what your character was doing before being recruited by your Inquisitor. It might not have been where your skills brought you to the attention of the Inquisitor, but it is likely. Once per session you may reroll a roll if you can describe how your background would have prepared you for this situation, using the This I Know special move.

  - Imperial Guardsman
  - Adeptus Arbites
  - Outcast
  - Ecclesiarchy
  - Adeptus Mechanicus
  - Adeptus Ministratrum

## Choose a Home World
Where you were born shapes a lot of the things about you. Select a home world and apply the related stat bonuses and penalties to your character. Each home world also has a small move associated with it.

### Death World
Death World characters gain +1 on all Last Breath rolls.  
+1 to Dexterity  
-1 to Intelligence  

### Feral World
Feral World characters +1 piercing when using primitive weapons.  
+1 to Strength  
-1 to Intelligence  
+2 to Load  

### Forge World
Forge World characters replace one of their d6s with a d8 when rolling Tech-Use.  
+1 to Intelligence  
-1 to Wisdom  

### Highborn
Highborn characters gain +1 to any Defy Danger or Parley rolls that involve talking to members of the Imperium.  
+1 to Charisma  
+10 to starting thrones  
-1 to Constitution  

### Hive World
Hive World characters gain +1 to any Defy Danger rolls when moving through crowds.  
+1 to Wisdom  
-1 to Strength  

### Voidborn
Voidborn gain +1 to any rolls to resist warp energy.  
+1 to Intelligence  
-1 to Charisma  

## Choose a Name
Select a name for your character. Make something up on your own or roll on the tables below to inspire you.

|d8|Male|Female|Nickname|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1|Gaius|Ellyn|Shiv|
|2|Bragg|Fernanda|Bullet|
|3|Mikkal|Xandra|Tooth|
|4|Ibram|Nelia|Krak|
|5|Kade|Serina|Grimshine|
|6|Othol|Dahlia|Dusk|
|7|Eli|Fenra|Carver|
|8|Lambdus|Rhia|Spider|

## Choose Look
Choose one item from each list for your class. If you want to go outside the list ask your GM.

## Choose Stats
Assign these scores to your stats: 16, 15, 13, 12, 9, 8. Start by looking over the basic moves and the starting moves for your class. Pick out the move that interests you the most: something you’ll be doing a lot, or something that you excel at. Put a 16 in the stat for that move. Look over the list again and pick out the next most important move to your character, maybe something that supports your first choice. Put your 15 in the stat for that move. Repeat this process for your remaining scores: 13, 12, 9, 8.

## Figure Out Modifiers
Next you need to figure out the modifiers for your stats. The modifiers are what you use when a move says +DEX or +CHA. If you're using the standard character sheets the modifiers are already listed with each score.

|Stat|Modifier|
|:--|:--|
|1-3|-3|
|4-5|-2|
|6-8|-1|
|9-12|0|
|13-15|+1|
|16-17|+2|
|18|+3|

## Set Maximum HP
Your maximum HP is equal to your class's base HP+Constitution score. Your Home World may affect your maximum HP. You start with your maximum HP.

*Base 6 and 9 Constitution gives me a base HP of 15.*

## Choose Alignment
Your alignment is a few words that describes how your character acts in their service to the Inquisition. Choose the alignment you most want to play; you'll earn XP for playing to your alignment.

## Choose Gear
Each class has choices to make for starting gear. Keep your load in mind—it limits how much you can easily carry. Make sure to total up your armor and note it on your character sheet.

## Introduce Your Character
Now that you know who your character is, it's time to introduce them to everyone else. Wait until everyone's finished choosing their name. Then go around the table; when it's your turn, share your look, class and anything else pertinent about your character. You can share your alignment now or keep it a secret if you prefer.

This is also the time for the GM to ask questions. The GM's questions should help establish the relationships between characters ("What do you think about that?") and draw the group into the adventure ("Does that mean you've met Grundloch before?"). The GM should listen to everything in the description and ask about anything that stands out. Establish where they're from, who they are, how they came together, or anything else that seems relevant or interesting.

## Choose Bonds
Once everyone has described their characters you can choose your bonds. You must fill in one bond but it's in your best interest to fill in more. For each blank fill in the name of one character. You can use the same character for more than one statement.

Take some time to discuss the bonds and let the GM ask questions about them as they come up. You'll want to go back and forth and make sure everyone is happy and comfortable with how the bonds have come out. Leave space to discover what each one might mean in play, too: don't pre-determine everything at the start. Once everyone's filled in their bonds read them out to the group. When a move has you roll+Bond you’ll count the number of bonds you have with the character in question and add that to the roll.
