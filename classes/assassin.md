## Starting Moves

### Backstab

When you **attack a surprised or defenseless enemy with a melee weapon**, you can choose to deal your damage or roll+DEX.

On a 10+ choose two.
On a 7–9 choose one.
  - You don’t get into melee with them
  - You deal your damage+1d6
  - You create an advantage, +1 forward to you or an ally acting on it
  - Reduce their armor by 1 until they repair it

### Poisoner
You’ve mastered the care and use of a poison. Choose a poison from the list below; that poison is no longer dangerous for you to use. You also start with three uses of the poison you choose. Whenever you have time to gather materials and a safe place to brew you can make three uses of the poison you choose for free. Note that some poisons are applied, meaning you have to carefully apply it to the target or something they eat or drink. Touch poisons just need to touch the target, they can even be used on the blade of a weapon.

  - Oil of Tagit (applied): The target falls into a light sleep
  - Bloodweed (touch): The target deals -1d4 damage ongoing until cured
  - Goldenroot (applied): The target treats the next creature they see as a trusted ally, until proved otherwise
  - Serpent’s Tears (touch): Anyone dealing damage to the target rolls twice and takes the better result.


### Called Shot
When you **attack a defenseless or surprised enemy at range**, you can choose to deal your damage or name your target and roll+DEX.

  - Head
    - 10+: As 7–9, plus your damage
    - 7-9: They do nothing but stand and drool for a few moments.
  - Arms
    - 10+: As 7-9, plus your damage
    - 7-9: They drop anything they’re holding.
  - Legs
    - 10+: As 7-9, plus your damage
    - 7-9: They’re hobbled and slow moving.

### Hunt and Track
When you **follow a trail of clues left behind by passing creatures**, roll+WIS.

On a 7+, you follow the creature’s trail until there’s a significant change in its direction or mode of travel.

On a 10+, you also choose 1:
  - Gain a useful bit of information about your quarry, the GM will tell you what
  - Determine what caused the trail to end

### Cheap Shot
When using a precise or hand weapon, your backstab deals an extra +1d6 damage.

You can apply even complex poisons with a pinprick. When you apply a poison that’s not dangerous for you to use to your weapon it’s touch instead of applied.

### Trap Expert
When you spend a moment to survey a dangerous area, roll+DEX.

On a 10+, hold 3.

On a 7–9, hold 1. Spend your hold as you walk through the area to ask these questions:

  - Is there a trap here and if so, what activates it?
  - What does the trap do when activated?
  - What else is hidden here?

### Tricks of the Trade
When you pick locks or pockets or disable traps, roll+DEX.
On a 10+, you do it, no problem.
On a 7–9, you still do it, but the GM will offer you two options between suspicion, danger, or cost.
