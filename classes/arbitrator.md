## Starting Moves

### I Am Justice
When you **give an NPC an order based on your Adeptus Arbites or Inquisitorial authority**, roll+Cha. On a 7+, they choose one:
  - Do what you say
  - Back away cautiously, then flee
  - Attack you

On a 10+, you also take +1 forward against them.
On a miss, they do as they please and you take -1 forward against them.

### Detective
When you **use Discern Realities on a crime scene** and roll a 7+ you also find a clue of value to you. On a 10+ this clue gives you a hunch that the GM will describe.

### Confessor 
When you **torture or beat someone to extract information from them** roll+Str. On a 7-9 they answer your questions and you choose 2. On a 10+ choose 1 instead.
  - They pass out from the pain
  - They add information they think you want to hear
  - They resist for longer than you'd planned
  
### Take Them Alive
When you **successfully hit a vulnerable opponent** you can attempt to disable them instead of dealing damage. Roll+Str, on a 7+ they are incapacitated. On a 7-9 choose 1:
  - They get one last attack in
  - You hit harder than you'd planned, maybe killing them
  - They will need some time to recover to be of any use

## Bonds

Fill in the name of on of your fellow acolytes in at least one:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ knows much about the enemy's ways, I should use that knowledge.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ walks a thin line too close to sedition, I should guide them.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has helped me defeat a formidable foe, I should repay them in kind.

## Gear
Your load is 10+Str. You start with rations, a stub revolver. Choose your melee weapon:

  - Warhammer (*close, +1 damage, 2 weight*)

## Advanced Moves - Level 2-5

###Shield Weapon
You expertly wield your shield as part of your offense. Add your shield's armor to your melee damage.

### Shield Wall
When your allies take cover behind your shield, they gain the armor benefit of your shield.

### Sacrifishield
When you take damage you can choose to have your shield take the damage instead, destroying it.

### This One's Mine
When you **call out a target as your own**, you deal +2d4 ongoing to them. This lasts until an ally attacks them, you attack someone else, or the target is defeated. While this is active you deal -4 damage to other targets and your allies deal -2 damage to your named target.

### Targeted Investigation
When you **publicly name a person or organization that you are after**, roll+Cha. On a 10+ hold 2, on a 7-9 hold 1. You may spend hold to get an automatic 10+ on rolls that directly involve your target. Proceed with caution, they know you're coming.

### Your Eyes Betray You
When you  **listen closely to someone** roll+Wis. On 7-9 the GM will tell you one thing they're lying about – if anything. On a 10+ the same and take +1 forward when acting on that information or against that person.

### Torturer
When you **roll a 7+ with Confessor** you may choose to select zero options from the list. If you do so, roll+Int – on a miss your captive dies.

### Local Informant

When you reach out to a local informant for specific information roll+Cha. On a 10+ you gain some intel and choose one. On a 7-9 the GM will also choose one:

  - Word comes slowly
  - The information is incomplete
  - You get two conflicting versions
  - Someone learns you're prying
  - Your informant demands something in return

## Advanced Moves - Level 6-10
