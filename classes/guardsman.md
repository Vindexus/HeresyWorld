## Starting Moves

### Throw Grenade
When you **prime and throw a grenade**, roll+Dex. On a 10+, the grenade lands where you aimed. On a 7-9 choose one:
  - The grenade lands where you aimed but you have to move to make the throw placing you in danger as described by the GM
  - The grenade only lands near where you aimed, for a reduced or dangerous effect as described by the GM
  
### Grab Grenade
When you **search your belt for a suitable grenade** roll+Wis. Expend one use of your Grenade Belt and choose a grenade to add to your inventory. On a 7-9 choose from this list:
  - Frag Grenade
  - Fire Bomb
  - Stun Grenade
  - Smoke Grenade
  - Krak Grenade

On a 10+ the same and you also take +1 forward to Throw Grenade.  
On a miss the GM will offer you a different grenade, or the one you were searching for at a cost.
  
### Suppressing Fire
When you **fire a weapon at one or more targets to suppress them**, roll+Dex and empty your clip. On a hit the target's morale is tested: they might dive for cover, falter, or attempt to flee. Your allies gain +1 forward against them. On a 10+ you also deal your damage.
