# The GM

## Agenda
Your agenda makes up the things you aim to do at all times while GMing a game of Heresy World:

  - Portray a grim dark galaxy
  - Fill the characters' lives with danger
  - Play to find out what happens

Everything you say and do at the table (and away from the table, too) exists to accomplish these three goals and no others. Things that aren't on this list aren't your goals. You’re not trying to beat the players or test their ability to solve complex mysteries. You’re not here to give the players a chance to explore your finely crafted setting. You’re not trying to kill the players (though heretics might be). You’re most certainly not here to tell everyone a planned-out story.

Your first agenda is to **portray a grim dark galaxy**. Heresy World is all about rooting out the vileness that threatens the Imperium, both from within and without. It’s about characters who have found themselves in a life of duty with glory in death being a satisfying end. It's your job to participate in that by showing the players a galaxy embroiled in war where their characters are needed. Without the player characters important regions of the Imperium would fall to xenos, mutants, psykers, or worse — it might still even with them. It’s up to you to portray the fantastic elements of that galaxy. Show the players the horrors of the universe they’re in and encourage them to react to it.

**Filling the characters’ lives with adventure** means working with the players to create a world that’s engaging and dynamic. Acolytes are always embroiled in investigating and disrupting plots against the Imperium

Heresy World missions **never** presume player actions. A Heresy World mission portrays a plot in motion—where players big and small are operating with their own goals. As the players come into conflict with that setting and its denizens, action is inevitable. You’ll honestly portray the repercussions of that action. Success is not guaranteed.

This is how you **play to find out what happens**. You’re sharing in the fun of finding out how the characters react to and change a city, a planet, a sector, or even the entire galaxy. You’re all participants in a great battle for mankind that has been unfolding for millenia. So really, don’t plan too hard. The rules of the game will fight you. It’s fun to see how things unfold, trust us.
