  description: '<p class="noindent">When you <strong>fire your ranged weapon to deal damage</strong>, roll+DEX and expend a use of your weapon. On a 10+ deal your damage. At your option you may expend another use of your weapon to add +1d4 damage. On a 7-9 you deal your damage and choose one:</p>' +
  '<ul class="options"><li>You take what you can get, deal -1d6 damage</li>' + 
  '<li>You need to take some more shots, expend another use of your weapon</li>' + 
  '<li>You have to place yourself or a teammate in danger, the GM will tell you how</li></ul>',
  explanation: '<p>{{aim_and_fire.name}} is your go-to move when a character is shooting to kill. It covers drawing, cocking, aiming, and shooting your weapon. Firing your weapon doesn\'t mean squeezing off a single shot, it means shooting for a few seconds. That can mean a single shot, or a whole flurry of them. Either way, it\'s a single use of the weapon. Leave the exact number of shots to the fiction and let the uses dictate when they run low.</p>' + 
  '\n<p>If you\'re using a weapon that doesn\'t have enough uses you can\'t take the bonus damage on the 10+ or the "expend another use" option on a 7-9.</p>'
