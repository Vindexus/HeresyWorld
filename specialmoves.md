# Special Moves

>## Fight Your Fear
>When you **witness a terrifying or gruesome sight**, roll+WIS. On a 10+ you steel yourself against the horrors you see, take +1 forward. On a 7-9 you waver for a second but then gather yourself – describe how. On a 6- choose a temporary effect and describe your character's mental breakdown.

>  - You repeat the same phrase over and over
>  - You run away as fast as you can
>  - You are frozen by fear
>  - You laugh hysterically
>  - You try to self mutilate
>  - You sob uncontrollably

>This effect lasts until you have a chance to calm down or someone snaps you out of it.

>## End of Session
>When you **reach the end of a session**, choose one of your bonds that you feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish.

>Once bonds have been updated look at your alignment or drive. If you fulfilled that alignment or drive at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these three questions as a group:

>  - Did we learn something new and important to the Inquisition?
>  - Did we overcome a notable enemy?
>  - Did we acquire a notable artifact that will be valuable to the Inquisition?

>For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.

>## Last Breath
>When **you’re dying** you see the darkness cloud your vision as you drift into death. Describe what thoughts or prayers spur you on and roll (don’t add any stat modifiers).  
On a 10+ you’ve defied the odds, and barely cling to life.  
On a 7-9 you live, but your brush with death takes its toll. Describe the lasting effects your body or mind take and the GM will tell you which of your characteristics you must reduce permanently by 1.  
On a 6-, you join the seemingly endless stream of souls to have been lost under the rule of the Imperium.  

When deciding on the permanent effect of 7-9 result, discuss with the player in question how they change. If they are plagued by nightmares perhaps their thinking skills suffer due to lack of sleep and they lose 1 Intelligence. Maybe the bolt round that downed them left a horrible scar on their face and they lose 1 Charisma.

The scars left by a brush with death should be taken into account in the fiction as well as the mechanics. If a character becomes terrified of mutants after they gut him and leave him for dead, then play that up when they meet more mutants. Don't just reduce their Wisdom by 1 and forget about the incident.

Remember to reduce a characteristic (Strength, Wisdom, etc), not a modifier (STR, WIS, etc).

>## This I Know
>Once per session, you may **invoke your Background to reroll a move**. To invoke your Background you must describe how your character's experience or a specific event would have helped you in the current situation. The GM and the players at the table have to agree, so the more details the better.

Details, details, details! Try to get as much information from your players as possible when they describe how their background comes into play. "I fought with the Imperial Guard" is certainly reason enough for their Background to be invoked when they're in a firefight, but as the GM you should try for more. Was there a similar fight to this? Similar foes? Terrain? Did they have drills for this type of fight? Take what they give you and remember it to use later in your campaigns and missions.
