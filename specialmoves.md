# Special Moves

## Fight Your Fear
When you **witness a terrifying or gruesome sight**, roll+WIS. On a 10+ you steel yourself against the horrors you see, take +1 forward. On a 7-9 you waver for a second but then gather yourself – describe how. On a 6- choose a temporary effect and describe your character's mental breakdown.

  - You repeat the same phrase over and over
  - You run away as fast as you can
  - You are frozen by fear
  - You laugh hysterically
  - You try to self mutilate
  - You sob uncontrollably

This effect lasts until you have a chance to calm down or someone snaps you out of it.

## End of Session
When you **reach the end of a session**, choose one of your bonds that you feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish.

Once bonds have been updated look at your alignment or drive. If you fulfilled that alignment or drive at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these three questions as a group:

  - Did we learn something new and important?
  - Did we overcome a notable enemy?
  - Did we acquire a notable artifact that will be valuable to the Inquisition?

For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.

## Last Breath
When **you’re dying** you see the darkness cloud your vision as you drift into death. Describe what thoughts or prayers spur you on and roll (don’t add any stat modifiers).  
On a 10+ you’ve defied the odds, and barely cling to life.  
On a 7-9 you live, but your brush with death takes its toll. Describe the lasting effects your body or mind take and the GM will tell you which of your stat scores you must reduce permanently by 1.  
On a 6-, you join the seemingly endless stream of souls to have been lost under the rule of the Imperium.
