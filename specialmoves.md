# Special Moves

## Fight Your Fear
When you **witness a terrifying or gruesome sight**, roll+WIS. On a 10+ you steel yourself against the horrors you see, take +1 forward. On a 7-9 you waver for a second but then gather yourself â€“ describe how. On a 6- choose a temporary effect and describe your character's mental breakdown.

  - You repeat the same phrase over and over
  - You run away as fast as you can
  - You are frozen by fear
  - You laugh hysterically
  - You try to self mutilate
  - You sob uncontrollably

This effect lasts until you have a chance to calm down or someone snaps you out of it.
