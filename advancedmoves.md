# Advanced Moves

The following moves can be taken by any class when they level up instead of of their class's advanced moves.

## Rapid Reload
When you **attempt to reload quickly** roll+DEX. On a 10+ you reload your weapon instantly - reset its uses and reduce your ammo by 1. On a 7-9 the same in addition to what that the GM says. On a 6- you fumble your reload.

## Hatred
Your hatred for a particular enemy of the Imperium runs deep. Each time you take this move, select one of the groups below and describe how your hatred took root. You take +1d4 damage ongoing against them.

## Medicae Training
When you **use medical supplies to tend to someone's wounds** roll+INT. On a 10+ choose two, on a 7-9 choose one:

  - Heal for an extra 1d6

On a 6- choose one:

  - Mark off an extra use of the supply
  - You heal for half the value, rounded down
  - It takes twice as long
