# Artifacts and Relics

Below are some example items that may find their way into the hands of an Inquisitor's cadre. They may be leant from the Inquisitor's personal armory for particularly dangerous missions, or pillaged from the corpses of slain enemies. Regardless of their source, they grant powerful boons to those that wield them.

### Krozium's Wrath
*Close, +1 damage, razor-sharp, 1 weight*

This sword once belonged to Arcaius Krozium, a Commissar of the Imperial Guard who did what few soldiers of the Imperium do – die of old age. His blade accompanied him through many battles of the Vartis Crusade against Chaos before he was no longer physically able to fight. Records of the swords whereabouts after his retirement are conflicting.

*Whenever you score a 12+ using Krozium’s Wrath for Hack & Slash you add the Messy, Forceful and Tearing tags to your attack.*

### Chalice of Divine Clarity

*0 weight, slow*

Golden and silver rods have been shaped and bent in a spiral to form the base of this chalice, before circling up to create the handle and joining into six tendrils that grasp the grim bowl of the chalice. This bowl, made of the lower half of the skull of an anointed Hero of the Imperium, is said to aid worthy servants of the Emperor whose senses must be sharp.

*After blessing the cup and its contents by reciting the proper hymns and litanies over it, drinking from this sacred relic grants you a serene clarity of thought. The next time you Discern Realities, roll with advantage.*

### Jacque DeTerre’s Recordings and Tales of Bravery of Mankind’s Great Crusade

*0 weight, slow*

This ancient tome, nearly ten thousand years old, has managed to stay in a usable form only through the careful ministrations of countless adepts throughout the ages. Its cover is decorated with a fading golden-threaded embroidery of a company of Space Marines charging the bristling cliff-like face of a xenos fortress.  The pages are filled with tales of bravery of the Emperor’s Adeptus Astartes during the Great Crusade of the 31st Millenium, recorded by the remembrancer Jacque DeTerre. Mankind’s reclamation of the stars is detailed in these accounts and in the transcribed interviews of Space Marine veterans.

*When you take the time to read the tales of this book before embarking on a mission, the actions of mankind’s bravest warriors take root in your mind, and can be called upon to inspire you. You and those you read to gain 1 hold, with a maximum of 1. You may spend 1 hold to add+2d6 to a damage roll.*

*A Spout Lore roll of 10+ on this artifact lets the player name which Space Marine legion the remembrancer Jacque DeTerre was attached to when he wrote the book, and a 7-9 lets the player choose from options presented by the GM.*

### Mordelan’s Pendant

*0 weight, worn*

A chain necklace, made of a cacophony of links of various metals in all states of rust, supports a diamond shaped circuit board of dizzying complexity the size of a child’s palm. Lights intermittently dance between the minuscule components of the circuit board, encircling a small crystal at its center. The circuit board and crystal, designed by Forge Master Mordelan, contain technology long since lost to the Adeptus Mechanicus that grants its wearer a powerful force field against xenos attacks.

*When the wearer of this pendant would take maximum damage from a xenos weapon or enemy it creates a temporary force field around them and the damage is negated.*

*A Spout Lore roll of 7+ on this artifact lets the player describe what the crystal at its center looks like. A 10+ also allows the player to describe what the force field looks like when activated.*

### Shield of the Eternal Candle

*1 weight, +1 armor, worn*

When a member of the Imperial Guard threw herself before a surprise counter attack aboard a Chaos frigate, armed only with the makeshift bulwark of a detached metal door, she selflessly protected three Sisters of the Order Hospitaller from the incoming enemy fire. Standing braced against the hail of bullets as the door factured and broke in her hands, she gave the Sisters the seconds they needed to retreat, saving their lives.

As grateful witnesses to this valorous event the three Sisters later returned and collected the shattered pieces of the improvised shield from where they lay next to the perforated corpse of the Imperial Guardsman. These pieces were then used in the forging of a new shield that was gifted from the Order of the Eternal Candle to the fallen guardsman’s company.

*When using this shield to defend another, you heal for +1d4 health whenever you are attacked.*

*A Spout Lore roll of 7+ on this item lets the player describe what decorations, if any, are present on the face of the shield. A 10+ lets the player name and describe the fallen guardsman.*
