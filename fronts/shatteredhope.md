# Shattered Hope

## Mission briefing

*We have received a request for aid from a detachment of the Imperial Guard who were sent to a nearby planet to quell a rebellion. Details are scarce, but what we know is that while fighting the rebels near one of the mines the world is known for, they encountered something worse. The local commander, Commissar Nihilius, has ordered the mine to be sealed shut until the Inquisition can investigate. A more experienced team from the Inquisition is en route, but you are tasked with heading to this planet, meeting with the Commissar located there, and gathering as much intel on the situation as possible.*

Questions for the players:

  - What is the name of this world?
  - What type of harsh climate does this world have?
  - What do they mine on this world?
  - What type of world is the regiment of Imperial Guard from?
  - I've taken a lot of the detail out of the description of the original Dark Heresy adventure and put some of those details into questions for the players.

## Cast: Imperial Guard

**Edwin Jurtz**: A young and hopeful guardsman, who believes the Acolytes are here to save them. Bright red hair, freckles.  
*Instinct*: To trust in the Imperium

**Sergeant Raynard**: A gruff guardsman with a bald head and a tattooed scalp. His right arm ends past the elbow, and attached is a metal rod with a disturbing array of attachments. His right eye is a crude false one.  
*Instinct*: To keep order in his camp

**Commissar Nihilius**: The Commissar is a man in his late thirties with coal black hair and coal black eyes. He wears a simple uniform adorned with a few badges showing his service and a flak vest.
*Instinct*: To perform his duty to the Imperium

## Danger: The Brotherhood of Malice

The Brotherhood of Malice is a desperate cult of beleaguered and desperate miners, menials, and laborers. Their goal is to provoke the Imperium to such an extent that they purge the entire world, freeing them and their loved ones of the endless cycle of strife that they live under.  
*Instinct*: to bring about their own doom

### Grim Portents

  - A captured prisoner of the rebellion reveals the Brotherhood's true intentions
  - A mutant with M-A-L-I-C-E tattooed across his six fingers is found, revealing the cult's Chaotic taint
  - Word spreads of who, exactly the Brotherhood of Malice worships
  - Impending doom: The world slips further into anarchy as rebellion spreads

### Things to find out:

  - What ancient heresy inspired the founding members of the Brotherhood?
  - Who does the cult worship? Is it one of the four Ruinous Powers, a great daemon, Chaos Undivided, or something else?


## Danger: Antithesis Stone

This pink glowing stone can be found deep within the mines. Its very fabric is tainted with powers of the warp.

### Grim Portents:

  - The stone spits out a half-formed lesser daemon that wanders the mines before dying of “natural” causes
  - The stone attempts to mutate any that enter into its presence
  - The stone summons a weakened but whole lesser daemon
  - Impending doom: A portal to the Immaterium is opened, releasing warp energies that mutate and lesser daemons that slaughter

### Things to find out: 

  - What does the stone look like?
 

## Custom Move: Antithesis Energy

When you **enter the chamber of the Antithesis Stone**, the stone pulses in anger and its energy attempts to mutate you. Roll+CON, on a 10+ you resist the stone entirely. On a 7-9 you resist with much difficulty, take -1 forward. On a miss you take -1 forward and roll a d10. Consult the table below for the stone's effect:

| Roll | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Skin Change: The character's hair and flesh turn a bright shade of pink with grey marbling just below the surface of the flesh. |
| 2 | Brute: The character grows muscled and brutish, but their head shrinks. The character increases their Strength by 1 but reduces their Intelligence by 1.|
| 3 | Tentacles: A sloppy mess of purple and warty tentacles sprout from the character's middle and flail about madly. |
| 4 | Huge Eyes: The unfortunate character's eyes grow huge, about the size of saucers. The Acolyte gains +1 to all rolls involving his sight, but takes -1 to all rolls while in bright light
| 5 | Huge Head: The character's head swells to three times its normal size, filled with strange fluid that aids in thinking. The character increases their Intelligence by 1, but reduces their Charisma and Wisdom both by 1 |
| 6-10 | The character gains a random debility |
