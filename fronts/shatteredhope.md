# Shattered Hope

## Mission briefing

*We have received a request for aid from a detachment of the Imperial Guard who were sent to a nearby planet to quell a rebellion. Details are scarce, but what we know is that while fighting the rebels near one of the mines the world is known for, they encountered something worse. The local commander, Commissar Nihilius, has ordered the mine to be sealed shut until the Inquisition can investigate. A more experienced team from the Inquisition is en route, but you are tasked with heading to this planet, meeting with the Commissar located there, and gathering as much intel on the situation as possible.*

Questions for the players:

  - What is the name of this world?
  - What type of harsh climate does this world have?
  - What do they mine on this world?
  - What type of world is the regiment of Imperial Guard from?
  - I've taken a lot of the detail out of the description of the original Dark Heresy adventure and put some of those details into questions for the players.

## Cast: Imperial Guard

**Edwin Jurtz**: A young and hopeful guardsman, who believes the Acolytes are here to save them. Bright red hair, freckles.  
*Instinct*: To trust in the Imperium

**Sergeant Raynard**: A gruff guardsman with a bald head and a tattooed scalp. His right arm ends past the elbow, and attached is a metal rod with a disturbing array of attachments. His right eye is a crude false one.  
*Instinct*: To keep order in his camp

**Commissar Nihilius**: The Commissar is a man in his late thirties with coal black hair and coal black eyes. He wears a simple uniform adorned with a few badges showing his service and a flak vest.
*Instinct*: To perform his duty to the Imperium

## Danger: The Brotherhood of Malice

The Brotherhood of Malice is a desperate cult of beleaguered and desperate miners, menials, and laborers. Their goal is to provoke the Imperium to such an extent that they purge the entire world, freeing them and their loved ones of the endless cycle of strife that they live under.  
*Instinct*: to bring about their own doom

### Grim Portents

  - A captured prisoner of the rebellion reveals the Brotherhood's true intentions
  - A mutant with M-A-L-I-C-E tattooed across his six fingers is found, revealing the cult's Chaotic taint
  - Word spreads of who, exactly the Brotherhood of Malice worships
  - Impending doom: The world slips further into anarchy as rebellion spreads

### Things to find out:

  - What ancient heresy inspired the founding members of the Brotherhood?
  - Who does the cult worship? Is it one of the four Ruinous Powers, a great daemon, Chaos Undivided, or something else?


## Danger: Antithesis Stone

This pink glowing stone can be found deep within the mines. Its very fabric is tainted with powers of the warp.

### Grim Portents:

  - The stone spits out a half-formed lesser daemon that wanders the mines before dying of “natural” causes
  - The stone attempts to mutate any that enter into its presence
  - The stone summons a weakened but whole lesser daemon
  - Impending doom: A portal to the Immaterium is opened, releasing warp energies that mutate and lesser daemons that slaughter

### Things to find out: 

  - What does the stone look like?
 

## Custom Move: Antithesis Energy

When you **enter the chamber of the Antithesis Stone**, the stone pulses in anger and its energy attempts to mutate you. Roll+CON, on a 10+ you resist the stone entirely. On a 7-9 you resist with much difficulty, take -1 forward. On a miss you take -1 forward and roll a d10. Consult the table below for the stone's effect:

| Roll | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Skin Change: The character's hair and flesh turn a bright shade of pink with grey marbling just below the surface of the flesh. |
| 2 | Brute: The character grows muscled and brutish, but their head shrinks. The character increases their Strength by 1 but reduces their Intelligence by 1.|
| 3 | Tentacles: A sloppy mess of purple and warty tentacles sprout from the character's middle and flail about madly. |
| 4 | Huge Eyes: The unfortunate character's eyes grow huge, about the size of saucers. The Acolyte gains +1 to all rolls involving his sight, but takes -1 to all rolls while in bright light
| 5 | Huge Head: The character's head swells to three times its normal size, filled with strange fluid that aids in thinking. The character increases their Intelligence by 1, but reduces their Charisma and Wisdom both by 1 |
| 6-10 | The character gains a random debility |


## Enemies

**Rebel**
Groups, Intelligent, Organized  
d8 damage, 6 HP, 1 armor  
Weapons: One of Laspistol/Stub Revolver, one of Crowbar/Pickaxe/Wrench  
Instinct: To upset the order  
The Rebel exists already in Dungeon World, but it’s a horde there and in this setting they work in smaller groups. I’ve changed it to a group which ups the damage from d6 to d8 and the hp from 3 to 6.

**Mutant Rebel**  
Groups, Intelligent, Organized  
d8 damage, 10 HP, 1 armor  
Weapons: One of Laspistol/Stub Revolver, one of Crowbar/Pickaxe/Wrench  
Mutation, choose one: Extra eyes, large eyes, scaled flesh, tentacle appendages, monstrous mouth, extra limbs  

**Mutant Guardsman**  
Solitary, Hand  
d10 damage, 12 HP, 1 armor  
Weapons: fists  
This man was once a member of the Imperial Guard, but has been terribly warped by the power of the Antithesis Stone. He feasts on the corpses he finds, and makes new ones when he can.
Instinct: to feast on the dead

**Mutant Abomination**  
Solitary, Reach, Forceful  
d10+2 damage, 16 HP, 1 armor  
Weapon: Jagged claws, fangs  
Moves: Toss aside  
This creature been tainted so severely that it is nearly unrecognisable as a former human. Its impossibly long arms each end in a single large jagged claw. Tufts of coarse fur emerge at various points on its body, particularly near its lamprey mouth. Instinct: to revel in slaughter
In terms of numbers this guy is the Mutant Guardsman with +2 damage, +4 HP and +1 armor. The real threat comes from its long arms which give it a much bigger range and the forceful tag, letting it knock the Acolytes around a bit.

**Weak Plaguebearer**  
Solitary, Terrifying, Close  
d10+2 damage, 18 HP, 2 armor  
Weapon: Barbed long sword  
Moves: Spew vitriol  
This writhing mass of decay and malaise is weaker than most Plaguebearers, as it has only been partially summoned, but it is no less repulsive. Instinct: To spread rot

***Move*: Nurglenomics**  
When a **Plaguebearer deals damage to you**, roll+CON. On a hit your body fights off the diseased essence of Nurgle. On a 10+ you steel yourself against the Plaguebearer and are no longer affected by this move. On a 6-you begin vomiting immediately, becoming vulnerable, and gain the Sick debility.

***Move*: Damage the Stone**  
When you **attack the Antithesis Stone**, roll+DEX if using a ranged weapon or roll+STR if attacking in melee. On a 10+ you hit the stone and deal 1 point of damage. On a 7-9 the same, but at a cost – the GM will tell you what. When the Stone has suffered 3 damage it shatters, sending the Plaguebearer hurtling back into the warp and ending its foul presence in this part of the mines.  
Possible costs: Use more ammo, suffer Nurglenomics, have the Stone attempt to mutate them again, draw the attention of the Plaguebearer, damage a melee weapon
