# Missions
Missions are organizational tools and narrative devices that the GM uses to create action and drama in the narrative. They are similar to Fronts in Dungeon World, but are built differently. Players in Heresy World are members of the Inquisition, and are thus given orders and directives that clearly state their goals and missions. This is different than Fronts in Dungeon World which exist waiting for the players to engage with them, as Missions are commonly thrust upon the players by their Inquisitor.

Missions are composed of the following sections:

  - **Briefing**: the first chunk of information relayed to the players. This is the hook, and should include the objective of the mission.
  - **Revelations**: pieces of information that the characters can learn about their mission. These will include blanks for the GM to fill out later, and checkmarks to mark off when the characters learn them.
  - **Stakes**: questions the GM asks before the mission starts that help the play stay open ended.
  - **Cast**: important characters involved in the mission. Any allies, named enemies, or notable locals will be part of the cast.
  - **Setbacks**: off-screen responses that the opposition can take in response to either character actions or bad rolls.
  
More sections can be added as needed, such as enemies, items, locations, custom moves, etc.
