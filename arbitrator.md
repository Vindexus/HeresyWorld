# Assassin

## Starting Moves

### I Am Justice
When you **give an NPC an order based on your Adeptus Arbites or Inquisitorial authority**, roll+Cha. On a 7+, they choose one:
  - Do what you say
  - Back away cautiously, then flee
  - Attack you

On a 10+, you also take +1 forward against them.
On a miss, they do as they please and you take -1 forward against them.

### Detective
When you **use Discern Realities on a crime scene** and roll a 7+ you also find a clue of value to you. On a 10+ this clue gives you a hunch that the GM will describe.

### Confessor 
When you **torture or beat someone to extract information from them** roll+Str. On a 7-9 they answer your questions and you choose 2. On a 10+ choose 1 instead.
  - They pass out from the pain
  - They add information they think you want to hear
  - They resist for longer than you’d planned
  
### Take Them Alive
When you **successfully hit a vulnerable opponent** you can attempt to disable them instead of dealing damage. Roll+Str, on a 7+ they are incapacitated. On a 7-9 choose 1:
  - They get one last attack in
  - You hit harder than you’d planned, maybe killing them
  - They will need some time to recover to be of any use
